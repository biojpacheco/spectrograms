#First line
#wl is for window lenght, for a quick assessment, suggested value for a is 256
#ovlp is for overlap %, suggested value for b can be assigned as 75 or 90 (overlap %)
#for wav.path assign a folder name ('YourFolder') where wav files are stored
$flim is for minimun (minf) and maximum (maxf) frequencies display in kHz

#Second line
#Maintain ame values for wl and ovlp
#sxrow is for seconds per row 
#rows is for number of rows
#collevels can be changed according to preferences
#values in seq (l,m,n): l is for lower -dB, m is for max dB = 0, n is for number of steps between min dB to 0dB
#Results will be saved as exported .jpg files
